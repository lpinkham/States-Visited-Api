README file for my States Visited  back-end project built by Lori Pinkham

States Visited

OBJECTIVE:

Build an app that will allow a user to keep track of the states that they have visited. It will also allow for some details like date visited, some highlights of thier visit and whether or not they would return in the future.

The game must be built as a single-page application.

TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLS USED:
- HTML
- CSS/SASS
- Handlebars
- Javascript
- Git / Git Hub
- jQuery
- API
- Ruby on Rails


DEVELOPMENT PROCESS:

My development process began with writing some users stories, drawing a wireframe and an ERD. This app requires two github repo's and heroku to host the API. I started with blank templates for the two repos and built them out from there. Starting with user auth was to me the best place to start. Once curl scripts were working I followed that with completing enough of the front-end to be able to login. Through-out the rest of the porject I made small changes, commited and tested before deploying.

PROBLEM SOLVNG STATEGIES:
To help resolve problems along the way I used console.log to print out objects, methods or whatever was needed to guide me to where the problem was. I also refered back to classroom assignments for reference on how we performed user authenticate.

FUTURE ITERATIONS:

- Allow the user to be able to see the states color coded on the map.
- Allow a user to see all records for each state so they can decide whether or not that would be one they want to visit.
